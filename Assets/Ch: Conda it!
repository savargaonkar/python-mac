A very simple way to quickly get Python and all the other stuff that it needs to work is to get something called Anaconda. 

All you need to do is download the package installer for macOS here. 

 

Install and run it with the basic guide helping you all the way. Anaconda is great because it's so simple and hardly requires any configuration from the user.

Plus, the distribution comes with a ton of great packages and has a super helpful documentation. So, if you get conda, you can Python in a jiffy. No more hassles.

After installing Anaconda, dive into the Python world by clicking Anaconda Navigator icon in your Launchpand or you can run the following command in your terminal:

anaconda-navigator
