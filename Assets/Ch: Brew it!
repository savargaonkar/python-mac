Homebrew calls itself The missing package manager for macOS and is an essential tool for any developer.

Installation

An important dependency before Homebrew can run is the Command Line Tools for Xcode. These include compilers that will allow you to build things from source, if you are missing this it's available through the App Store > Updates.

To install Homebrew paste the following command (without the $) in your terminal, hit Enter, and follow the steps on the screen:

$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
One thing we need to do is tell the system to use programs installed by Hombrew (in /usr/local/bin) rather than the OS default if it exists. We do this by adding /usr/local/bin to your $PATHenvironment variable (if you're using oh my zsh you should use .zshrc instead of .bash_profile):

$ echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
Alternatively, we can also insert /usr/local/bin to the first line of /private/etc/paths and reboot the Mac to change global paths loading order. Admin password may be required if you modify the file.

To be able to use brew you need to start a new terminal session. Do this by opening a new terminal tab with Cmd+T (you should also close the old one), then run the following command to make sure everything is working:

$ brew doctor

USING HOMEBREW
To install a package (or Formula in Homebrew vocabulary) simply type:

$ brew install <formula>
To update Homebrew's directory of formulae, run:

$ brew update
Homebrew keeps older versions of packages installed, in case you want to roll back. That rarely is necessary, so you can do some cleanup to get rid of those old versions:

$ brew cleanup
To see what you have installed (with their version numbers):

$ brew list --versions

PYTHON WITH HOME BREW
To install Python 2.7 plus any dependencies required (it can take a few minutes to build everything) just run the following in your terminal window (always without the $, your default terminal window will always start with the following username$ ):

$ brew install python
When finished, you should see a summary in the terminal. 

Plus running this line: $ which python should output : /usr/local/bin/python.

It also installs pip (and its dependency Setuptools), which is the package manager for Python. 

Finally, let's get them upgraded. Run both the lines:

$ pip install --upgrade setuptools
$ pip install --upgrade pip
Executable scripts from Python packages you install will be put in /usr/local/share/python, we already had this in the Env.sh file created before. Save the file and open a new terminal to take the new $PATH into account (everytime you open a terminal, .bash_profile gets loaded).
